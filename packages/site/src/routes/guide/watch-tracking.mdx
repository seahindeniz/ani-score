# {frontmatter.title}

When you connect your AniList account, AniScore shows your personal watch progress on anime cards.

## Watch Progress

For anime on your AniList watch list, you'll see:

- **Current episode** -- how far you've watched
- **Total episodes** -- including currently aired episodes for ongoing series
- **Watching indicator** -- a visual badge on anime you're actively following

This makes it easy to pick up where you left off without checking AniList separately.

## Favorites

AniScore lets you manage your AniList favorites directly from the streaming site:

- **Heart icon** shows whether an anime is in your favorites
- **One-click toggle** to add or remove from favorites
- **Favorite count** from the AniList community is displayed alongside

## Privacy

AniScore only accesses your AniList data with your explicit authorization. Your AniList token is stored locally in your browser's extension storage and is never sent to any third-party server. All API calls go directly to AniList's official API.
