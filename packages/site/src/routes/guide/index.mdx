title: What is AniScore?
---

# {frontmatter.title}

AniScore is a browser extension that brings [AniList](https://anilist.co) ratings, genres, tags, and your personal watch progress directly onto anime streaming sites.

Instead of switching between tabs to check an anime's score or remember which episode you're on, AniScore overlays that information right on the streaming site's anime cards.

## How It Works

1. **Browse any supported streaming site** as you normally would
2. **AniScore detects anime cards** on the page using smart title matching
3. **Ratings and details appear** directly on each card via a clean, non-intrusive overlay
4. **Connect your AniList account** to also see your watch progress and manage favorites

## What You'll See

On each anime card, AniScore can display:

- **Community score** from AniList (average rating)
- **Popularity ranking** and trending status
- **Genre labels** with customizable colors
- **Content tags** from AniList's tagging system
- **Your watch progress** (current episode / total episodes)
- **Favorite status** with one-click toggle

## Supported Sites

AniScore currently supports:

- [Anizm.net](https://anizm.net) -- a popular Turkish anime streaming site

More sites will be added over time. The extension is built with an extensible architecture that makes adding new sites straightforward.

## Open Source

AniScore is fully open source. You can view the code, report issues, or contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/seahindeniz/ani-score).
