AniScore displays rich anime metadata from AniList directly on streaming site cards.

## What's Displayed

### Scores & Popularity

Each anime card shows the AniList community score and popularity data. Trending anime are highlighted with a special indicator so you can quickly spot what's hot this season.

### Genres

Genre labels appear below the score, giving you an instant overview of the anime's categories. You can customize the color of each genre label through the side panel settings.

### Tags

AniList's detailed content tags (up to 5 per anime) are also displayed. Like genres, tag colors are fully customizable.

## Data Source

All data comes from the [AniList GraphQL API](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/). AniScore uses an offline anime database from the [manami-project](https://github.com/manami-project/anime-offline-database) for fuzzy title matching, then fetches detailed information from AniList.

This two-step approach ensures accurate matching even when streaming sites use different title formats or romanizations.
